>>> Using PyPi With pip install

- PyPI is a repository for open-source third-party Python packages.
- It's similar to RubyGems in the Ruby world, PHP's Packagist, CPAN for Perl, and NPM for Nodes.
- So far we've really only used libraries that come internally with Python.
- There are many other libraries available that people have open-sourced and shared on PyPi.
- We can use pip install at the command line to install these packages.
- By installing Python from python.org or through the Anaconda distribution you also installed pip
- pip is a simple way to download packages at your command line directly from the PyPi repository
- A quick google search will usually help you discover a link to the PyPi page for the package, or for the package documentation.

            eg, requests, Tensorflow, flask, etc

- Modules are just .py scripts that you call in another .py script
- Packages are a collection of modules
