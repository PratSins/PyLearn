This is about Decorators and Generators in Python

def simple_func():
    # Do simple stuff
     return something

Decorators are commonly used with web framworks

**************************************************************
----Generators----

> Generator functions allow us to write a function that can send back a value and then later resume to pick up where it left off.
> This type of function is a generator in Python, allowing us to generate a sequence of values over time.
> The main difference in syntax will be the use of a yield keyword statement.
> When a generator function is compiled they become an object that supports an iteration protocol.
> That means when they are called in your code they don't actually return a value and then exit.
> Generator functions will automatically suspend and resume their execution and state around the last point of value generation.
> The advantage is that instead of having to compute an entire series of values up fron the generator computes one value waits
  until the next value is called for.
> For example, the range() function doesnâ€™t produce an list in memory for all the values from start to stop.
> Instead it just keeps track of the last number and the step size, to provide a flow of numbers.
> If a user did need the list, they have to transform the generator to a list with >> list(range(0,10))
